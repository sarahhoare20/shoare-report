# Introduction

Access to a **clean water** supply is a *human right*. Therefore, the amount of the population using surface water is a ***critical issue***, especially in developing countries. For a lot of people in **developing countries**, their primary water source is from rivers, lakes, and ponds. They use this water daily for drinking and bathing. The use of surface water poses a significant **risk** to the health of people because diseases such as hepatitis A, typhoid and polio can develop because of a lack of access to clean water. Therefore, it is important to Dive into the Data'  and examine **'The Flow of Surface Water Usage'** to see how this pressing issue can be addressed. 

This interactive document will focus on data supplied by ***UNICEF***, to provide a detailed review of the usage of surface water across different regions of the world. 

The graphs and visualisations shown are: 

1. Two World Maps showing data from **2010** and **2022**
2. Time Series 
3. Scatterplot 
4. Two Bar Charts showing data from **2010** and **2022**
5. Bubble Chart 

Now, Let's Dive into the Data!


# Maps
```{r}
 
map_world <- map_data("world")

#map 2022

data_join %>% 
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  full_join(map_world, by = c("country" = "region")) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = obs_value)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "orange", high = "green") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of the Population using Surface Water in each country in 2022",
  fill = "%") +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Arial")  
  )
```

This ***World Map*** shows the proportion of the population using surface water in each country in the year **2022.**The *darker* the shade of green, the *higher* the proportion of the population that use surface water. On the other hand, the *lighter* the shade of orange, the *lower* the proportion of the population that use surface water. It clear that the populations of ***Europe, North America and Oceania*** use very little surface water. Whereas people in ***Africa and Asia*** use more surface water."


```{r}
#map 2010

data_join %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
full_join(map_world, by = c("country" = "region")) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = obs_value)) +
  geom_polygon()+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "orange", high = "green") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of the Population using Surface Water in each country in 2010",
       fill = "%") +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Arial")
  )
```

"This ***World Map*** shows the proportion of the population using surface water in each country in the year **2010**. Just like the 2022 Map, the *darker* the shade of green, the *higher* the proportion of the population that use surface water. On the other hand, the *lighter* the shade of orange, the *lower* the proportion of the population that use surface water. It clear that the populations of ***Europe, North America and Oceania* use very little surface water. Whereas people in ***Africa and Asia*** use more surface water.

*These visualisation makes it easy to see how the number of people using surface water has declined over the last 12 years.*

# TimeSeries 
```{r}

#timeseries 
install.packages("plotly")

library(plotly)

timeseries_plot_1 <- data_join %>%
  filter(year >= 2000 & year <= 2022) %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(year, obs_value, group = country, color = continent)+
  geom_line()+
  
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Percentage of the Popualtion usign Surface Water",
       title = "Percentage of the Popualtion using Surface Water from 2000 to 2022")+
  theme(text = element_text (family = "Arial"))


ggplotly(timeseries_plot_1)

```


This ***Time Series Visualisation*** shows the proportion of the population using surface water from **2000-2022**. 

### Trends from the Time Series: 
 - as time goes on the proportion of the population using surface water **decreases** in most countries.
 
 - ***Papua New Guinea*** is a clear *outlier* in this graph, with the highest proportion of the population using surface in every year across the ***22 years*** examined.

- Despite this, the proportion of the population using surface water in ***Papua New Guinea*** decreased by *28.31%* from *49.38%* in **2000** to *21.07%* in **2022**.



# Scatter Plot 
```{r}


#scatterplot 

scatter_plot <- ggplot(data_join)+
  aes(obs_value, life_exp, color = continent, size = obs_value)+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  
  labs(x = "Percentage of Population Using Surface Water",
       y = "Life Expectancy",
       title = "Evolution of the Relationship between Life Expectancy and the Percentage of Population Using Surface Water")+
  theme(text = element_text (family = "Arial"))


  hover_info <- paste("Country: ", data_join$country, "<br>",
                      "Observation Value: ", data_join$obs_value, "<br>",
                      "Life Expectancy at Birth: ", data_join$Life_exp_at_birth)

  

ggplotly(scatter_plot)
```


This **Scatterplot** shows the relationship between **life expectancy** and the **proportion of population using surface water** overtime. 

### Findings from the scatterplot: 

- When the proportion of the population using surface water *decreases*, life expectancy *increases*. 
- This suggests that there is a ***positive correlation*** between using less surface water and increased life expectancy.  




# Barchart 
```{r}

#barchart 

library(ggplot2)

data_join %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(m_life_exp = mean(life_exp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(continent, m_life_exp, fill = continent) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    x = "Continent",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "Life Expectancy in each Continent in 2020"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Arial"),  
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green", "orange", "purple", "yellow", "blue"))


```



This **barchart** shows the **Life Expectancy** in each **Continent** in **2020**. 

- **Oceania** has the *highest* Life Expectency in 2022

- **Africa** has the *lowest* Life Expectency in 2022

*These results are consistent with the 2010 results as shown below*


```{r}
#barchart 2010

library(ggplot2)

data_join %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(m_life_exp = mean(life_exp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(continent, m_life_exp, fill = continent) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    x = "Continent",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "Life Expectancy in each Continent in 2010"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Arial"),  # Change font family to Arial
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green", "orange", "purple", "yellow", "blue"))



```


This **barchart** shows the **Life Expectancy** in each **Continent** in **2010**. 

- **Oceania** has the *highest* Life Expectency in 2010

- **Africa** has the *lowest* Life Expectency in 2010


# Bubble Chart 
```{r}

#bubble chart 

library(ggplot2)

data_join %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(m_life_exp = mean(life_exp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(continent, m_life_exp, fill = continent, size = m_life_exp) +  
  geom_point(shape = 21) +  
  labs(
    x = "Continent",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "Life Expectancy in each Continent in 2010"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Arial"),  
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green", "orange", "purple", "yellow", "blue"))

```
### Bubble Chart 

This **Bubble Chart** shows the **Life Expectency** in each **Continent** in **2010**.  

### Trends:

1. ***Oceania*** has the *highest* Life Expectency in ***2010***

2. ***Africa*** has the *lowest* Life Expectency in ***2010***

*this is consistent with the data in the Bar Chart above*

# Conclusion 

To conclude, this document provides *valuable insights and visualisations* into the **proportion of the population using surface water** in different regions of the world overtime. 

The figures have been **steadily decreasing** in many parts of the world over the last number of years. 

Despite this, there is a still a lot of work to be done to **tackle this issue**. 

### Recommendations: 

1. ***International collaboration*** 

2. ***Investment in Infrastructure***

3. ***Promoting Hygiene***

Overall, it is important to ***'Dive into the Data'*** and uncover a ***long-term solution*** to this problem!
